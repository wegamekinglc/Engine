/*! Black single name CDS option engine

    Prices single name CDS option instruments quoted in terms of strike spread. It is assumed that the volatility 
    structure's strike dimension, if there is one, is in terms of spread also. This is the standard situation for 
    single name CDS options.

    The valuation follows the approach outlined in <em>Modeling Single-name and Multi-name Credit Derivatives, 
    Dominic O'Kane, 2008, Section 9.3.7</em>. This is also the approach in <em>A CDS Option Miscellany, Richard 
    J. Martin, 2019, Section 2.1 and 2.2</em>. If we need the approach in Section 2.4 of that paper, we would need 
    to make adjustments to the forward spread and RPV01 in our calculation which may in turn need access to the ISDA 
    supplied interest rate curve. We leave that as a possible future enhancement.
