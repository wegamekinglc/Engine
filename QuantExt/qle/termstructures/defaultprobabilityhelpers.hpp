class CdsHelper : public RelativeDateDefaultProbabilityHelper {
public:
    /*! Constructor
        @param quote  The helper's market quote.
        @param tenor  CDS tenor.
        @param settlementDays  The number of days from evaluation date to the start of the protection period. Prior to
                               the CDS Big Bang in 2009, this was typically 1 calendar day. After the CDS Big Bang,
                               this is typically 0 calendar days i.e. protection starts immediately.
        @param calendar  CDS calendar. Typically weekends only for standard non-JPY CDS and TYO for JPY.
        @param frequency  Coupon frequency. Typically 3 months for standard CDS.
        @param paymentConvention  The convention applied to coupons schedules and settlement dates.
        @param rule  The date generation rule for generating the CDS schedule. Typically, for CDS prior to the Big
                     Bang, \c OldCDS should be used. After the Big Bang, \c CDS was typical and since 2015 \c CDS2015
                     is standard.
        @param dayCounter  The day counter for CDS fee leg coupons. Typically it is Actual/360, excluding accrual end,
                           for all but the final coupon period with Actual/360, including accrual end, for the final
                           coupon. The \p lastPeriodDayCounter below allows for this distinction.
        @param recoveryRate  The recovery rate of the underlying reference entity.
        @param discountCurve  A handle to the relevant discount curve.
        @param startDate  Used to specify an explicit start date for the CDS schedule and the date from which the
                          CDS maturity is calculated via the \p tenor. Useful for off-the-run index schedules.
        @param settlesAccrual  Set to \c true if accrued fee is paid on the occurrence of a credit event and set to
                               \c false if it is not. Typically this is \c true.
        @param protectionPaymentTime  Time at which protection payments are made when there is a credit event.
        @param lastPeriodDayCounter  The day counter for the last fee leg coupon. See comment on \p dayCounter.
