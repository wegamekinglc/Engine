\subsubsection{Swap}

The \lstinline!SwapData! node is the trade data container for the \emph{Swap} trade type. A Swap must have at least one leg,
and can have an unlimited number of legs. Each leg is represented by a \lstinline!LegData! trade component sub-node,
described in section \ref{ss:leg_data}. An example structure of a two-legged \lstinline!SwapData!
node is shown in Listing \ref{lst:swap_data}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Settlement [Optional]: Delivery type applicable to cross currency swaps, and ignored for all other swap types. Delivery type does not impact pricing in ORE, but npv results are produced with and without SIMM exemptions.  

Settlement \emph{Cash} indicates that principal exchanges on the cross currency swap should be included in Initial Margin (IM). According to ISDA non-deliverable (\emph{Cash}) trades are excluded from the exemption from IM for the principal exchange, i.e. the principal exchanges are included in IM. 

Settlement \emph{Physical} indicates that principal exchanges on the cross currency swap should be excluded in IM (the ISDA exemption applies).  

Allowable values: \emph{Cash} or \emph{Physical}.  Defaults to \emph{Physical} if left blank or omitted.
\end{itemize}

Note that Swaps in non-deliverable currencies with payment in a deliverable currency are supported by setting Settlement  to \emph{Cash} and - on both legs - using the Indexings node (\ref{ss:indexings}), as well as setting the Currency to the deliverable currency, while keeping the Notional expressed in the non-deliverable currency amount. 

Within the  Indexings node,  an fx Index field is mandatory defining the deliverable and non-deliverable currencies and fixing source. The Indexing node can also include optional FixingCalendar, IsInArrears and FixingDays fields to determine the date(s) of the fx fixing(s). See Listing \ref{lst:ndir_swap} for an example non-deliverable IR swap where USD is the payment currency and CLP is the non-deliverable currency.
