\subsubsection{Equity Barrier Option}

European exercise, American barrier.

The \lstinline!EquityBarrierOptionData!  node is the trade data container for the \emph{EquityBarrierOption} trade type. The barrier level of an Equity Barrier Option should be quoted in the currency of 
the underlying Equity spot price. The \lstinline!EquityBarrierOptionData!  node includes one  \lstinline!OptionData! trade component sub-node and one \lstinline!BarrierData! trade component sub-node plus elements
specific to the Equity Barrier Option. 

An Equity Barrier Option is a path-dependent option whose existence depends upon an Equity underlying
spot price reaching a pre-set barrier level. Exercise is European.

This product has a continuously monitored single barrier (American Barrier style) with a Vanilla European Equity
Option Underlying.

The structure of an example \lstinline!EquityBarrierOptionData! node for an Equity Barrier Option is shown in Listing
\ref{lst:eqbarrieroption_data}.
