We provide a number of trade wrappers that read a ``normal'' ORE XML and translates this internally to the script data
structure. Examples include the trade types

\begin{itemize}
\item DoubleDigitalOption
\item PerformanceOption\_01
\item Autocallable\_01.
\end{itemize}

The implementation of a wrapper is usually done by inheriting from ScriptedTrade and implementing the fromXML(), toXML()
and build() methods appropriately, see one of the classes on how this is done in detail.
