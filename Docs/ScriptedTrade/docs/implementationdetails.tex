\subsection{Static Analysis}\label{static_analysis}

Extracts a superset of

\begin{itemize}
\item indices and associated observation dates from evaluation operator applications (see \ref{index_evalop}) as well as
  forward dates, if applicable
\item observation dates from the PAY function (see \ref{function_pay}) or from the DISCOUNT function (see
  \ref{function_discount}) as well as payment dates / discount end dates; this is done per currency
\item dates on which a conditional expectation is required from the NPV function (see \ref{function_npv})
\end{itemize}

that can possibly occur in a concrete script execution. The results from the static analysis are used to set up the
model against which the script is eventually run.

\subsection{Script Parser}

Translates the script into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

\subsection{Script Analyzer}

Extracts information from the AST and a concrete set of external data that is needed to set up and calibrate a model
like the index names and the required simulation times for the indices.

\subsection{Script Engine}

Runs a script on the AST using a certain model type against a concrete model instance and given a concrete set of
external data.

\subsection{Model}

Interface that a model must implement so that the script engine can be run against it. An example is the BlackScholes
class.
